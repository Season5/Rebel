    <string name="about">Rebel is the third studio album by Christian rap artist, Lecrae.\n
    Rebel is titled after Lecrae's encouragement to rebel against modern pop culture, \n
        also pointing out that Jesus Christ himself was a rebel. Lecrae has stated that the title of \n
        the album is both a noun and a verb. \n
        Rapzilla called the album "a verbal onslaught against the world's\n
        view on life in modern day culture."</string>
    <string name="names">Monicah Kwamboka, Jay Vianney Kayitare and Grace John.</string>
    <string name="lecrae">One of the leading lights in the gospel-rap movement, Lecrae also has the chart-topping records to prove it. For the typical music fan, his hard demeanor and crunk beats might belie what his lyrics are really about: his adoration of Jesus Christ. </string>
